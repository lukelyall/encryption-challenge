# Encryption Coding Challenge
## Description
Create a program that, when given a message from a file and an integer key, encrypts the message by adding the ASCII number for each character to the character's index and to the key and then converts that sum to binary.

The program should also be able to decrypt any encrypted messages it creates.

Try to make the program as fast as possible in the language of your choice.
## Usage
```
./cpp_challenge.out -<e or d> <integer_key> -i <input_file>
```
